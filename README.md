# memoriesBank

This solidity dApp allows user to create his/her own MemoriesBank contract account on ethereum network.

MemoriesBank account is very much like diary. It can be used to create and store memories. 

Each memory has a date and description. User can also specify if it represents a positive, neutral or negative event. 

This is my first "bigger" solidity project. It is fully functional, however the code may not be too elegant, as I'm just beginning my adventure with JS and React.
